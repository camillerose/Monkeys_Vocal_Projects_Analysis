# Monkeys_Vocal_Projects_Analysis
These are MATLAB scripts utilized during my dissertation work. These scripts analyze the natural vocal interactions of marmosets.

# Natural Interruptions Analysis
This project analyzed the role of interruptions during monkey vocal communication. This code takes a list of vocalization times from the natural interactions of two marmosets calling back and forth to each other. It outputs:
- the total calls for each marmoset
- the number of interruptions that occurred
- when into the otherâ€™s call an interruption occurred (i.e., did they occur at the beginning or end?) 
- the likelihood of a response after an interruption
- the latency to call of each marmoset after an interruption
